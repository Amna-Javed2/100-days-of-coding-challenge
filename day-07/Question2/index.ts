/*Question 20 Think of something you could store in a array.
For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries,
cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.*/


let books: string[] = ["Physics", "Math", "Computer"];
// console.log(`Books I'd like to read, ${books}.`);     // combine

books.forEach(book =>{
    console.log(`Book I'd like to read, ${book}.`);      // separate
})
