// Question 10: Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs youâ€™ve written,
// and add at least one comment to each. If the programs are straightforward
// at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each
// program file. Then, write one sentence describing what the program does.

// Explain & TIP: Comments are notes in your code that the computer ignores.
// They help people understand what your code does. It's like leaving a note
//  for yourself or someone else who might read your code later.

// My Full Name 
// Date: 24/05/2024
